# Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy, Clarity, and Reproducibility
All information presented must be accurate, clearly articulated, and reproducible by others. Claims must be supported by verifiable sources to ensure the highest academic integrity.

### Claims Supported by Sources
Every claim or statement of fact must be explicitly backed by credible, verifiable sources. The majority of sources (>= 50%) must be peer-reviewed academic publications. A minimum of 15 total references is required.

<h3>Academic Tone and Readability</h3>
The textbook must maintain an academic tone suitable for a Grade 10-12 readability level. All citations must adhere strictly to APA style guidelines.

### Zero Plagiarism and Fact-Check Verification
The content must be entirely original, with zero tolerance for plagiarism. All facts presented must undergo rigorous fact-check verification to ensure correctness and reliability.

<h3>Traceability and Verification of Claims</h3>
All claims made within the textbook must be fully traceable to their original sources. The entire written content must pass comprehensive plagiarism and fact-checking processes.

## Project Specifications and Constraints

**Project Title**: Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
**Audience**: Education administrators evaluating AI adoption for classrooms, seeking improved student outcomes and reduced teacher workload.
**Format**: Docusaurus for development, deployed via GitHub Pages.
**Word Count**: The final manuscript must be between 5,000 and 7,000 words.
**Deliverable**: PDF export with embedded citations.

## Quality Assurance and Review

Content will undergo rigorous review to ensure adherence to all core principles, standards, quality rules, and constraints. This includes automated plagiarism checks, manual fact verification, and readability assessments.

## Governance

This Constitution serves as the foundational document for the project. Any amendments to this Constitution require documented rationale, review, and approval by relevant stakeholders, along with a plan for migrating existing content or practices to the new standards. All contributions to the project must demonstrate compliance with the principles outlined herein.
