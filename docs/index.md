Welcome to the working documentation site for the "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

This site is powered by Docusaurus. Use the `docs/` folder to add chapters, guides, and reference material. The canonical specification files remain in `specs/`.

Getting started:

- Read the project specification in `specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md`.
- Run the dev server with `npm install` then `npm start`.
