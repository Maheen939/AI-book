## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive 4-phase project plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook:

- **Phase 0** (Weeks 1-3): Research & source collection (15+ references, ≥50% peer-reviewed)
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 4-7): Content drafting (5,000-7,000 words with APA citations)
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 8-10): Quality assurance (plagiarism check, fact-verification, QA checklist)
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 11-12): Finalization & deployment (Docusaurus + GitHub Pages)

Plan includes detailed tasks, deliverables, success criteria, risk mitigation, and resource recommendations for each phase.

## Outcome

✅ Comprehensive plan created and documented at `/plan.md`
✅ Clear phase breakdown with timeline
✅ All deliverables and success metrics defined
✅ Ready to proceed to Phase 0 (Research & Collection)
