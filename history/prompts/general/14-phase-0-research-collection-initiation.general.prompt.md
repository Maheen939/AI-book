## Prompt

phase 0

## Response snapshot

Initiated Phase 0: Research & Source Collection with complete framework and tracking templates.

**Created:**
1. `phase-0-research-framework.md` - Complete research strategy, database search plan, content outline structure, quality checklist, and milestones
2. `phase-0-references.md` - Reference tracking spreadsheet, database search checklist, and progress tracking

**Phase 0 Goals:**
- Collect 15+ credible references (≥50% peer-reviewed)
- Create detailed textbook outline
- Timeline: December 7-28, 2025 (3 weeks)

**Research Strategy:**
- Peer-reviewed sources: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv (Target: 10-12 sources)
- Case studies: ASIMO, Atlas, Pepper, educational platforms (Target: 3-5 sources)
- All sources formatted in APA 7th Edition with DOI verification

**Content Outline Structure:**
- Preface (250–300 words)
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI (1,500–2,000 words)
- Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics (1,500–2,000 words)
- Chapter 3: AI in Physical Systems (1,500–2,000 words)
- Appendix: Additional Resources (500–750 words)

## Outcome

✅ Phase 0 framework ready
✅ Research databases identified
✅ Reference tracking templates created
✅ Content outline structure defined
✅ 7-task todo list created for Phase 0
✅ Ready to begin source identification

**Next Steps:**
1. Search IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv
2. Identify 10-12 peer-reviewed sources
3. Document 3-5 case studies & credible sources
4. Format all references in APA 7th Edition
5. Validate quality (≥50% peer-reviewed, DOIs verified)
6. Create detailed outline by Dec 28
