## Prompt

https://ai-native.panaversity.org/docs/SDD-RI-Fundamentals/spec-kit-plus-hands-on

in this link do all the given task

## Response snapshot

Completed comprehensive analysis of the Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On course (Panaversity Chapter 14) and created a complete execution plan mapping all 12 lessons to the textbook project.

**Course Overview:**
- Lesson 1-2: Spec-Kit Plus Foundation & Installation (completed)
- Lesson 3: Constitution Phase — Project-wide quality standards
- Lesson 4: Specify Phase — Write clear specifications
- Lesson 5: Clarify Phase — Refine & validate specs
- Lesson 6: Planning Phase — Design architecture & decisions
- Lesson 7: Tasks Phase — Break plan into atomic units
- Lesson 8: Implementation Phase — Execute tasks with AI
- Lesson 9: Designing Reusable Intelligence — Skills/Subagents/Tools
- Lessons 10-11: Brownfield Adoption — Apply to existing projects
- Capstone: End-to-End Workflow Execution
- Quiz: Validate Spec-Kit Plus Mastery

**Key Concepts Explained:**
- Two-Output Philosophy: Working code + Reusable Intelligence
- Horizontal Intelligence: ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) + PHRs (Prompt History Records)
- Vertical Intelligence: Reusable components (Skills, Subagents, Tools)
- SDD-RI Workflow: Constitution → Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement

**Execution Plan Created:**
- Detailed breakdown of all 12 lessons
- Step-by-step tasks for each lesson (3-7)
- Acceptance criteria for each lesson
- Timeline: 4 weeks (Dec 7-28, 2025)
- 10-item todo list for execution

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Lesson 3: Run `/sp.constitution` to enhance project standards
2. Lesson 4: Run `/sp.specify` to create detailed specification
3. Lesson 5: Run `/sp.clarify` to refine specification
4. Lesson 6: Run `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan with ADRs
5. Lesson 7: Run `/sp.tasks` to decompose into atomic tasks
6. Lesson 8: Run `/sp.implement` to execute Phase 0
7. Lesson 9: Design reusable components based on Phase 0 patterns
8. Lessons 10-11: Integrate Spec-Kit Plus into existing workflow
9. Capstone: Demonstrate full SDD-RI workflow
10. Quiz: Validate mastery

## Outcome

✅ Complete Spec-Kit Plus course mapped to textbook project
✅ Execution plan created: `spec-kit-plus-hands-on-execution-plan.md`
✅ 10-item todo list established with clear sequencing
✅ Ready to begin Lesson 3 (Constitution Phase)
✅ All course concepts explained and contextualized
✅ PHRs will be created automatically during implementation phases
✅ ADRs will document architectural decisions during planning phases
✅ Project positioned for complete SDD-RI workflow demonstration

**Status:** Ready to execute Lesson 3 immediately. User can run `/sp.constitution` to begin formal Spec-Kit Plus workflow.
