# PHR: /sp.plan run

Date: 2025-12-07

Action: Generated implementation plan and created ADRs for Zotero choice, four-phase approach, and source priority. Added `specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/plan.md` and ADRs under `history/adr/`.

Decisions:
- Zotero + Better BibTeX chosen for reference management.
- Four-phase implementation approach adopted.
- Source priority and paywall handling policy established.

Next: Assign owners and begin Phase 0 tasks (research & source collection). Save progress in daily PHRs.
