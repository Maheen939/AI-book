# PHR: /sp.implement Phase 0 start

Date: 2025-12-07

Action: Started Phase 0 implementation. Added atomic tasks, an automated arXiv BibTeX fetch script, and reference placeholders.

Files created:
- `specs/physical-ai-robotics-textbook/tasks.md`
- `scripts/fetch_arxiv_bib.ps1`
- `references/references.bib` (placeholder)
- `references/README.md`

Next actions:
- Run `scripts/fetch_arxiv_bib.ps1` locally to seed `references/references.bib`.
- Manually add peer-reviewed, paywalled, or standards documents to Zotero and export via Better BibTeX.
- Create PHR entries per search session.
